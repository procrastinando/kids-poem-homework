# kids-poem-homework
This project provides a web-based interface for language learners to practice and assess their pronunciation of poems in multiple languages. It utilizes Gradio for the UI, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for generating audio, and Groq Whisper API for transcribing user-recorded audio. The application supports English, Spanish, Chinese, and Russian.
